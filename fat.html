               <p>"It was way more than I thought," the 35-year-old told TODAY. "I was just mad at myself. It really just hit me and I thought, 'You got to do something. You are almost 400 pounds.'"
                At first, he decided on gastric bypass surgery and had to lose some weight ahead of the procedure. In his first two months following an eating plan, he lost 55 pounds. He lost 45 more by June, a total of 100 pounds.
                It was at that point he decided not to go forward with the surgery. He had also started exercising, first just by walking. He eventually joined a gym and goes five days a week, still walking on the weekends.
                "I am stronger than I ever thought I was. I never had any confidence and now I see how far I have come. I can run. I can do burpees. I can do push-ups. I can do planks. I take these small victories," he told TODAY.

                After the birth of her daughter in 2007, however, things changed for Saintfort. Weighing 291 pounds, her highest, she decided to try dieting. But it wasn't until her daughter turned 10 and one of her classmates called Saintfort "fat" that she made lasting changes. 
                "She looked so sad, and she’s trying to act like it wasn’t a big deal. At that moment it hit me that she’s suffering, and she’s being picked on or laughed at because of my laziness or my unhealthy choices," Saintfort told the magazine.
                 She cut out fast food and soda and started doing daily three-mile walks around the lake in her town.

                 <div class="post8"><p>Barry Parkes never really worked out and didn't eat healthily, but thought he was fine as long as he didn't weight 300 pounds. However, when he got to the point where he did weigh 325 pounds, he knew something had to change.
                 "That's when it really hit me," he told Men's Health. But he didn't quite know where to start in order to make a lasting impact until one of his coworkers recommended getting a Fitbit.  
                 The device and app helped Parkes create a calorie budget and he also started going on daily walks with his wife.
                 After about a year and a half, he lost 122 pounds. He said he now has more energy and doesn't snore anymore. Plus, he and his wife have found they're even more in love than before, he told the outlet.
                 "The key is you got to commit to it first," he said. "You got to be at the point where enough is enough. You got to commit to doing it and then you've got to stick with it and be consistent."

                 <div class="post9"><p>Jen Wagner had always been athletic, but when she got married, she stopped working out and gained 100 pounds, reaching her highest weight of 240 pounds in 2017.
                "I felt like a stranger in my own body. I didn't recognize my own reflection, and when I would see photos of myself, I was disgusted. I didn't know who that was," she told Popsugar.
                Though she had tried for six years to lose weight on fad diets and different programs, she finally buckled down in February this year. She started with her diet, first on keto, then to low-carb. Now she tracks her calories using MyFitnessPal and does intermittent fasting.
                She also exercises by playing tennis, swimming, walking with hand weights, jumping on trampolines with her daughter and even doing yard work.
                "I never did something that made me miserable and not want to do it again," she told POPSUGAR. "I haven't stepped foot inside of a gym even one time on this journey."
